# About

## Brief introduction

Python is a multi-pardgimed, dynamically typed and general purpose language.
It was built on top of C yet it's run time is still slow due to the fact that
it is:

1. Dynamically typed
2. Uses garbage collection
3. Interpreted rather than compiled

## Main uses for Python

Due to its general purpose nature, Python can be used for almost any context.
Though it does well in:

- AI/ML
- Fullstack Web development
- Data analytics

It also uses [virtual environments](virtual_environments/about.md)
to install packages in an isolated manner (not affecting the overall system).
