# Personal documentation for random things I've learned

## Reason for creation

This is just going to be an amalgamation of all the things that I have learned.
It will also act as a prototype for a documentation system that I am working on.

## Languages I use

- Python
- Javascript
- Lua
- C/C++ (I rarely use this)
- Java (I rarely use this)
- Bash
- HTML/CSS
